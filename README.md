# ES2001 MATLAB Coding Corals
- Repository of project using MATLAB to analyse effect of climate change on survival of corals in the North Pacific Ocean from 2000 to 2015
- Hypothesis: Climate change has a direct impact on coral population, however different species of corals exhibit varying degree of resilience
- Parameters used to measure climate change are: 
  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  - Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA)
  - Ocean Heat Content (OHC)
  - Total Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration in ocean
  - Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs)
  - Mean Seawater pH
  - Bleaching hotspots
- Parameters used to measure/estimate coral survivability include:
  - Coral population
  - Coral distribution
  - Bleaching severity code
  - Bleaching occurence probability
- Specific role in project:
  - Extract and plot severity code data
  - Plot interpolated bleaching probability data
  - Plot all climate change indicators on a map
  - Animate change in climate change indicators on maps from 2000 to 2015 by creating .gif files (These are found in the "Codes" folder of this repository)
- More details are found in final report, ES2001_MATLAB_FinalReport.pdf
