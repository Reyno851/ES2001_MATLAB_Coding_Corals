# ES2001 MATLAB Coding Corals
- Repository of project using MATLAB to analyse effect of climate change on survival of corals in the North Pacific Ocean from 2000 to 2015
- Parameters used to measure climate change are: 
  - Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  - Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA)
  - Ocean Heat Content (OHC)
  - Total Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration in ocean
  - Degree Heating Weeks (DHWs)
  - Mean Seawater pH
  - Bleaching hotspots
- Details are in final report, ES2001_MATLAB_FinalReport
